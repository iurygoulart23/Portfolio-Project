# Portfolio-Project

 <h2> Date a Cientist </h2>
 
<p> "Main goal: Create machine learning models to make a prediction about relationship app users. In the real world, the app uses predictions like this to estimate compatibility among users and then suggest matches. The specific goal here is to compare and contrast the performance of supervised machine learning models to predict the religious preference of users based on other aspects of their profiles. A supplemental -learning- exercise is to see whether a natural language processing model can predict which user wrote a very brief essay.</p>
    
<h2> In this project i will analyse a dataset with some tools like NLP and Machine Learning Models </h2>
   <h3> For this project i used:</h3>
    <p>- Matplotlib</p>
    <p>- Pandas</p>
    <p>- NumPy</p>
    <p>- Sklearn library</p>
    <p>- KMeans classifier</p>
    <p>- Logistic Regression classifier</p>
    <p>- Decision Tree classifier</p>
    <p>- Random Forest classifier</p>
    <p>- Confusion Matrix</p>
    <p>- Scipy Stats</p>
    
   <p> "With the analytics from the various columns that we have we could to get some insights to every aspect that we need" </p>
