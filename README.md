# Portfolio-Project

 <h2> Date a Cientist </h2>
 
<p> "Main goal: Create machine learning models to make a prediction about relationship app users. In the real world, the app uses predictions like this to estimate compatibility among users and then suggest matches. The specific goal here is to compare and contrast the performance of supervised machine learning models to predict the religious preference of users based on other aspects of their profiles. A supplemental -learning- exercise is to see whether a natural language processing model can predict which user wrote a very brief essay.</p>
    
<h2> In this project i will analyse a dataset with some tools like NLP and Machine Learning Models </h2>
   <h3> For this project i used:</h3>
    <p>- Matplotlib</p>
    <p>- Pandas</p>
    <p>- NumPy</p>
    <p>- Sklearn library</p>
    <p>- KMeans classifier</p>
    <p>- Logistic Regression classifier</p>
    <p>- Decision Tree classifier</p>
    <p>- Random Forest classifier</p>
    <p>- Confusion Matrix</p>
    <p>- Scipy Stats</p>

**Conclusion**: The Random Forest Classifier learning method performed best with a baseline score of 55%, which is somewhat successful and better than guessing (where 11% accuracy would be expected.) The model possibly could be refined for better accuracy, however there is a real concern of forcing/overfitting the data.

**The Natural Language Processing** learning exercise resulted in a model that made the correct prediction in average of 1.9/10 times, very slightly better performance compared to guessing (where 1/10 times is expected.) Note again that this was a learning exercise using available but not entirely adequate data, and as such this was successful. </p>
